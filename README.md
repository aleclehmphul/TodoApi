# Todo Application Api

This is a Web API built using ASP.NET and C#. The API creates a robust backend for a Todo App. The API can receive HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. The API communicates with a Microsoft SQL Server database to retrieve, update, or delete Todo items depending on the HTTP request sent.


A Todo item contains an id, name, and isComplete field.
