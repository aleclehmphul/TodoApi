# Todo Application Api

This is a Web API built using ASP.NET and C# creating the API backend for a Todo Application. The API can receive HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests and communicates with a Microsoft SQL Server database to retrieve, update, or delete Todo items depending on the HTTP request sent.


A Todo item contains an id, name, and isComplete field.
